In September 2022 I will be starting my MRes/PhD studies in Financial Economics at the [Center for Finance](https://centreforfinance.org) based in the [Department of Economics](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/economics/) at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk).

Before joining UCL, I was an Economic Analyst at the Economic Research Area of the [Central Bank of Chile](https://portalbiblioteca.bcentral.cl/en/web/banco-central/) conducting research and policy analysis in the fields of macroeconomics and financial intermediation.
